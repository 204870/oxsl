# Yet Another Model for Cross Situational Word Learning
Project for APLN 552: Computational Cognitive Modeling of Language

Cross Situational word learning model, that learns word meaning through vector semantics and object detection

uses the [flicker8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) and [flicker30k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset) datasets from kaggle

heavily inspired by [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2014.tal-3.3.pdf) and its [source code](https://github.com/kadarakos/IBMVisual)

tested with the [wordsims3 benchmark](https://github.com/204870/wordsims3)
