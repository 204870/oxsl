# Yet Another Model for Cross Situational Word Learning
Project for APLN 552: Computational Cognitive Modeling of Language

Cross Situational word learning model, that learns word meaning through vector semantics and object detection

uses the flicker8k and flicker30k datasets from kaggle

heavily inspired by [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2014.tal-3.3.pdf) and its [source code](https://github.com/kadarakos/IBMVisual)

tested with the [wordsims3 benchmark](https://github.com/204870/wordsims3)
